--- Day 10: Elves Look, Elves Say ---

Today, the Elves are playing a game called look-and-say. They take turns making sequences by reading aloud the previous sequence and using that reading as the next sequence. For example, 211 is read as "one two, two ones", which becomes 1221 (1 2, 2 1s).

Look-and-say sequences are generated iteratively, using the previous value as input for the next step. For each step, take the previous value, and replace each run of digits (like 111) with the number of digits (3) followed by the digit itself (1).

For example:

1 becomes 11 (1 copy of digit 1).
11 becomes 21 (2 copies of digit 1).
21 becomes 1211 (one 2 followed by one 1).
1211 becomes 111221 (one 1, one 2, and two 1s).
111221 becomes 312211 (three 1s, two 2s, and one 1).
Starting with the digits in your puzzle input, apply this process 40 times. What is the length of the result?

Your puzzle input is 1321131112.


--- Day 11: Corporate Policy ---

Santa's previous password expired, and he needs help choosing a new one.

To help him remember his new password after the old one expires, Santa has devised a method of coming up with a password based on the previous one. Corporate policy dictates that passwords must be exactly eight lowercase letters (for security reasons), so he finds his new password by incrementing his old password string repeatedly until it is valid.

Incrementing is just like counting with numbers: xx, xy, xz, ya, yb, and so on. Increase the rightmost letter one step; if it was z, it wraps around to a, and repeat with the next letter to the left until one doesn't wrap around.

Unfortunately for Santa, a new Security-Elf recently started, and he has imposed some additional password requirements:

Passwords must include one increasing straight of at least three letters, like abc, bcd, cde, and so on, up to xyz. They cannot skip letters; abd doesn't count.
Passwords may not contain the letters i, o, or l, as these letters can be mistaken for other characters and are therefore confusing.
Passwords must contain at least two different, non-overlapping pairs of letters, like aa, bb, or zz.
For example:

hijklmmn meets the first requirement (because it contains the straight hij) but fails the second requirement requirement (because it contains i and l).
abbceffg meets the third requirement (because it repeats bb and ff) but fails the first requirement.
abbcegjk fails the third requirement, because it only has one double letter (bb).
The next password after abcdefgh is abcdffaa.
The next password after ghijklmn is ghjaabcc, because you eventually skip all the passwords that start with ghi..., since i is not allowed.
Given Santa's current password (your puzzle input), what should his next password be?

Your puzzle input is hxbxwxba

--- Day 12: JSAbacusFramework.io ---

Santa's Accounting-Elves need help balancing the books after a recent order. Unfortunately, their accounting software uses a peculiar storage format. That's where you come in.

They have a JSON document which contains a variety of things: arrays ([1,2,3]), objects ({"a":1, "b":2}), numbers, and strings. Your first job is to simply find all of the numbers throughout the document and add them together.

For example:

[1,2,3] and {"a":2,"b":4} both have a sum of 6.
[[[3]]] and {"a":{"b":4},"c":-1} both have a sum of 3.
{"a":[-1,1]} and [-1,{"a":1}] both have a sum of 0.
[] and {} both have a sum of 0.
You will not encounter any strings containing numbers.

What is the sum of all numbers in the document?
